### Post 1: AI Failure Statistics
80% of AI projects fail.

Not because the technology doesn't work.

Because companies try to boil the ocean instead of automating one workflow at a time.

Start small. Prove ROI. Scale carefully.

### Post 2: Data Entry Reality Check
Your team shouldn't be copy-pasting data in 2026.

If someone spends more than 30 minutes a day on data entry, that's a workflow begging to be automated.

Email → CRM
Calls → Notes
Leads → Research

All solvable. One at a time.

### Post 3: The Hidden Cost
That "quick 5-minute task" your team does 20 times a day?

That's 100 minutes daily.
8+ hours weekly.
400+ hours yearly.

One automation = one full-time employee's worth of time back.

What would your team do with an extra 400 hours?

## Social Proof / Results Posts

### Post 4: Case Study - Email to CRM
Client was paying someone $52K/year just to copy emails into Salesforce.

Built one automation.
Now runs 24/7.
Zero errors.

That person now does actual sales work.

This is what "AI transformation" should actually mean.

### Post 5: Case Study - Lead Research
Sales reps spending 20 min researching each lead = 15 hours/week wasted.

One lead enrichment workflow later?
Instant research. Full context. Ready to call.

15 hours back to actually sell.

ROI in week one.

Everyone wins.

## Pain Point / Problem Awareness Posts

### Post 7: The Sales Call Problem
Recording every sales call but never using the data?

You're sitting on a goldmine of:
• Feature requests
• Objection patterns
• Competitive intel
• Customer pain points

One automation turns calls into actionable insights.

### Post 8: The Churn Warning
Most companies find out customers are unhappy when they see the cancellation email.

Way too late.

Sentiment analysis on support calls flags at-risk accounts BEFORE they churn.

Prevention > damage control.
