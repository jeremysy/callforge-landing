# CallForgr: One Workflow at a Time

## What We Do

CallForgr helps businesses automate their most time-consuming workflows—one at a time. Instead of promising a massive AI transformation, we focus on finding the single process that's eating the most time in your business and automating it completely.

## The Problem We Solve

Every business has workflows that seem simple but consume hours of work:
- Processing incoming emails and entering data into CRM systems
- Researching leads before sales calls
- Responding to support tickets
- Taking notes from meetings and calls
- Generating weekly reports

Most business owners know AI could help, but they're hesitant. Their workflows are critical. They've been refined over time. Breaking them would be expensive.

"Let me automate everything with AI" sounds risky. And it is.

## Our Approach: Careful, Focused, Proven

That's why we work differently.

**Step 1: You describe one workflow**
The repetitive task that takes forever. The work your team dreads. Just one process you wish would run itself.

**Step 2: We show you what's possible**
No sales pitch. We send a personalized walkthrough showing exactly how we'd automate your specific workflow. You decide if it makes sense.

**Step 3: We build it carefully**
If you want to move forward, we build the automation. We test it alongside your existing process. No disruption until you're 100% confident it works.

**Step 4: We decide what's next together**
One automation working? Great. Want to tackle another? We repeat. Don't want more? That's fine. You're always in control.

## Real Results from Single Workflows

These numbers come from automating just ONE workflow in each business:

- **$52,000 saved per year**: One email-to-CRM workflow that used to require a full-time person now runs automatically.

- **15 hours saved per week**: One lead research workflow. Sales reps were spending 20 minutes per lead doing manual research. Now it's instant.

- **4-minute response time (was 4 hours)**: One support ticket workflow that now runs 24/7. Customers get answers immediately.

## Types of Workflows We Automate

- **Email processing**: Incoming emails automatically parsed, contacts created, follow-ups scheduled
- **Lead enrichment**: Company info, LinkedIn profiles, news, talking points—ready before the call
- **Support tickets**: Read the issue, check history, send the right response. Works around the clock.
- **Call documentation**: Transcribe, extract key points, create action items, update CRM automatically
